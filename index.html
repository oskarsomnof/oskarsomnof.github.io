        <p>Tallinn-based composer specializing in cinematic, electronic, and industrial music. My work walks the line between harmony and dissonance, beauty and ugliness. I was initially trained in classical and jazz piano before discovering the guitar in my teens, which led me toward heavier music and, eventually, into electronic, industrial, and cinematic experimentation. Though I draw inspiration from various artists, I’ve developed a personal style and sound—at times sweet and dreamy, at others aggressive, abrasive, and dark.</p>
